## üóìÔ∏è Week 6 ‚Äì Project Log  
**Date:** 

---

### ‚úÖ **Tasks Completed**
- Researched alternative sentiment analysis tools to replace `TextBlob`.
- Identified **Hugging Face Transformers** as the most suitable solution due to its accuracy and support for state-of-the-art models like `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`.
- Updated the Python script (`analyze_sentiment_stdin.py`) to use the `transformers` pipeline for sentiment classification.
- Installed necessary libraries: `transformers`, `torch`, and `hf_xet` to support model loading and execution.
- Modified the backend to continue supporting streamed input/output with the updated Python model.
- Confirmed that the updated system outputs sentiment polarity and labels, now based on transformer predictions.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Challenges Encountered**
- **Module Import Error**: Encountered `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers'` after installing the library. This was due to it being installed outside the virtual environment.
- **Incorrect Python Reference**: Node.js was initially spawning the system Python instead of the venv‚Äôs Python where `transformers` was installed.
- **Model Load Delay**: Hugging Face model required first-time download and caching. This was resolved by installing `hf_xet`, which enabled proper loading and storage.

---

### ‚úÖ **Outcome**
- The transformer-based sentiment analysis is now fully integrated into the workflow.
- Results are **noticeably more accurate**, especially for nuanced or complex AI-generated responses.
- Output maintains the same structure (sentiment, polarity, bias index) and remains compatible with the existing frontend and visualization tools.
- This upgrade improves both the **credibility** and **depth** of bias analysis across AI models.

### üîú **Next Steps**
- Continue refining sentiment scoring if needed (e.g., support for confidence thresholds).
- Optionally explore multilingual or domain-specific models using Hugging Face.
