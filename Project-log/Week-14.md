Certainly! Here's the updated **daily development log** including your backend performance improvements for handling a large number of questions with Gemini and DeepSeek:

---

### üìÖ **Daily Development Log**

**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Project:** AI Bias Detector App

---

#### ‚úÖ **1. Hugging Face LLaMA Integration Troubleshooting**

* Attempted to integrate Meta‚Äôs LLaMA model from Hugging Face.
* Encountered repeated `401 Unauthorized` and `404 Not Found` errors due to:

  * Missing or incorrect `HF_API_TOKEN`.
  * Model access restrictions (pending approval).
  * Misconfigured model endpoint path (e.g., `text-generation` vs `chat/completions`).
* Reviewed the ‚Äú**affiliate**‚Äù field in Hugging Face‚Äôs license request form; determined it's optional and used for organizational association (e.g., university or company).
* Submitted license access request; currently pending.

---

#### ‚úÖ **2. Frontend Enhancement: App Introduction Section**

* Designed and implemented a new **Intro section** with:

  * A simple usage guide (how to enter a topic, what models are used, etc.).
  * System requirements including AVX2 CPU support (required for running Hugging Face-hosted LLaMA models).
* Positioning:

  * Initially placed **below the docktop** and **above the footer**.
  * Experimented with placing it **below the main content** and **centered**.
  * Final layout: **below main content**, but visually **raised** using CSS (`marginTop: -100px`) to keep it in view without disrupting the flow.

---

#### ‚úÖ **3. Performance Optimization: Gemini & DeepSeek**

* Refactored the backend logic to **improve performance for analyzing large numbers of questions (e.g., 100)**:

  * **Gemini** (Google):

    * Now uses **batch processing** where possible to reduce overhead from sequential API calls.
    * Implemented efficient payload formatting to minimize token bloat.
  * **DeepSeek**:

    * Switched to **parallelized requests** using `Promise.allSettled()` to reduce total wait time when processing multiple questions.
    * Added basic error isolation to allow partial results even when individual calls fail.
* Added logic to prevent request failures from stalling entire analysis for any one model.
* Introduced a backend config parameter to limit or retry requests per provider for more robust scaling.

---

#### ‚úÖ **4. Layout Testing & UI Feedback**

* Iterated several layout configurations based on feedback:

  * Intro section: centered, full-width, top-of-page, and raised positioning tested.
  * Rolled back to original full-width design for consistency and readability.
* UI now reflects a cleaner onboarding experience without pushing core functionality down.

---

#### üß† **Learnings & Notes**

* Hugging Face gated models require careful endpoint validation and explicit access.
* API token handling must be secure and properly scoped.
* For models like Gemini and DeepSeek, performance bottlenecks emerge at \~50+ questions unless calls are parallelized or batched.
* Intro sections should assist new users without obstructing core functionality ‚Äî solved via visual elevation without DOM reordering.

---

#### ‚è≠Ô∏è **Next Steps**

* Monitor Hugging Face access approval.
* Once approved:

  * Integrate LLaMA with correct `text-generation` inference endpoint.
  * Wrap API in retry logic with logging.
* Consider a caching layer for duplicate topic analysis to further reduce wait time.
* Enhance UI responsiveness when analyzing 100 questions with animations or progress feedback.
