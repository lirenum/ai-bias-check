Here’s your **daily project log** for today:

---

### ✅ **Daily Development Log — AI Bias Detection App**

**📅 Date:** 2025-04-26

---

#### **🔧 Tasks Completed**

* **Fixed Blank History Page**
  Investigated and resolved an issue where clicking the “History” button resulted in a blank page. The cause was a missing or incorrectly configured `SessionLog` component and a missing `type="button"` attribute in the button inside a form.

* **Created `SessionLog.js` Component**
  Implemented the `SessionLog` component to display previously logged AI bias analysis sessions using `useEffect` and Axios to fetch data from the backend.

* **Integrated “Delete All Logs” Feature**

  * Added a **new DELETE route** on the Express server to clear the `sessions.json` file.
  * Created a **Delete All Logs** button in the `SessionLog` component with user confirmation and error handling.

* **Enhanced UX**

  * Styled the delete button with a red background for emphasis and clarity.
  * Improved layout for clarity and consistency with the app’s color palette and spacing.

---

#### **⚠️ Challenges**

* The frontend would reset or behave unexpectedly due to form submission side effects. Resolved this by adding `type="button"` to non-submit buttons.
* Ensuring deletion reflects immediately on the frontend without needing a manual refresh.

---

#### **📌 Next Steps**

* Add the ability to delete **individual** logs from the session list.
* Optionally allow users to **export** or **download** session logs as JSON or CSV.
* Implement filtering/searching inside the log view for better navigation as data grows.
