# 📝 **Daily Project Report**

**Date:** 7 May 2025
**Project:** AI Bias Detection & Sentiment Analysis Platform
**Developer:** \[Your Name]
**Phase:** Implementation, UI/UX Integration & Testing

---

## ✅ **Key Accomplishments**

### 1. **Feature Enhancement – Detailed View for Model Responses**

* Implemented a **click-to-expand** system where each AI model block in the UI now acts as a link.
* Clicking a model opens a **dedicated full-screen view** (`/model/:modelName`) displaying:

  * All generated **questions and answers**.
  * **Sentiment breakdown** (e.g., *Positive: 40%, Negative: 30%*) shown under each Q\&A.
* Grid layout and visual clarity were added for improved user experience.

### 2. **Sentiment Display Integration**

* Incorporated sentiment scores beneath each Q\&A pair in the format:

  ```
  🟢 Positive: 40% | 🔴 Negative: 30% | 🟡 Neutral: 30%
  ```
* This allows users to easily understand sentiment skew per response.

### 3. **Routing Infrastructure**

* Set up **React Router** with:

  * `/` for the main analyzer
  * `/logs` for session history
  * `/model/:modelName` for detailed model breakdowns
* Enabled **back-navigation** and seamless routing between views.

---

## 🧪 **Testing and Debugging**

### Backend Test Setup:

Created and ran **smoke tests** to validate API keys and endpoints for:

* ✅ OpenAI (ChatGPT)
* ✅ Gemini Pro
* ✅ DeepSeek
* ✅ HuggingFace (LLaMA 2)

Each API was tested using standalone scripts to confirm successful model replies.

### Health Check Endpoint:

* `/health` route added to backend for availability testing.
* Verified via `curl` and browser.

### Integration Testing:

* Verified `POST /analyze-questions` with real inputs to ensure:

  * Response schema integrity.
  * Sentiment and summary extraction logic works across models.

## 🧩 **Next Steps**

* [ ] **Polish UI Styling** (fonts, colors, spacing, card design).
* [ ] Add **session persistence** to save detailed logs (optional DB or file-based).
* [ ] Enable **exporting session data** to CSV or PDF.
* [ ] Add **tooltip explanations** for bias and sentiment scores.
* [ ] (Optional) Add a model performance comparison summary card.

## 🧠 Reflection

Today’s focus was on **functionality depth and user navigation**. We moved beyond surface metrics and enabled users to see exactly how each model responded—providing the transparency necessary for genuine bias detection. With proper testing in place, the system is now much more robust and ready for further enhancements.
