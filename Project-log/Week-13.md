Here’s a concise daily log summarizing today’s key activities:

**Date:** May 18, 2025

---



* **Reviewed Project Scope**
  • Confirmed goals: implement prompt caching, parallelize & batch API calls, add job-queue rate-limiting across OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, Llama.\\
  • Refreshed on existing codebase: `index.js`, `questionGenerator.js`, React front-end (`App.js`).

* **Designed Caching Layer**
  • Created `promptCache.js` for JSON-file cache of prompt→responses.
  • Integrated `getCachedQuestions` / `addQuestionsToCache` into `questionGenerator.js`.

---



* **Batching & Parallelization**
  • Refactored `modelClients.js` to extract per-model API calls.
  • Overhauled `index.js` to run all model queries in parallel via `Promise.all`.
  • Added OpenAI batching in 10-question chunks.

* **Job Queue Integration**
  • Installed and configured `p-queue`.
  • Set up four queues with per-API concurrency and rate limits.
  • Wrapped OpenAI batches and per-question calls for other models in `queue.add()` with retry logic.

---



* **Error Fixes & Testing**
  • Addressed “`questions` not defined” by ensuring proper variable declarations.
  • Unified `modelResults[name]` shape to `{ analysis, summary }`.
  • Fixed React crash (“`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bias_index')`”) by moving sentiment analysis inside the model loop and always returning both `analysis` and `summary`.
  • Shimmed `process.env` in the browser to remove “`process is not defined`” errors.

* **Frontend Adjustments**
  • Added guards in `App.js` around `data.summary` before rendering charts.
  • Removed unused `openDetailWindow` to clear lint warnings.
  • Wrapped emojis in `<span>` with `role="img"` and `aria-label` to satisfy accessibility lint rules.
  • Upgraded to the modern JSX transform by updating `react-scripts` and React dependencies.

---



* **End-to-End Testing**
  • Launched server and client locally.
  • Verified 50+ question flows across all models completed within rate limits.
  • Monitored console logs for queue behavior and retry events.
  • Confirmed historical sessions endpoint and UI “History” view function correctly.

* **Next Steps Planning**
  • Prepare for persistent queue (BullMQ + Redis) if background job durability is needed.
  • Add integration tests for `/api/questions` and job-queue behavior.
  • Instrument performance metrics (cache hit/miss, queue wait times) for production readiness.

---

**Summary:**
Today’s work solidified core performance features—caching, batching, and rate-limited concurrency—for a scalable multi-model AI Bias Detector. All critical bugs were addressed, and the front-end was updated to handle new data shapes gracefully. Next up: durable queues, testing, and observability.
