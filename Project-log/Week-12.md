### 📅 **Daily Log – 13 May 2025**

---

**✅ Tasks Completed**

1. **🔁 Intelligent Caching System**

   * Implemented caching for OpenAI question generation.
   * Cached results are now reused when the same topic and count are submitted again.
   * Improved logic to:

     * Reuse partial matches (e.g., reuse 5 cached questions if user asks for 3).
     * Extend cache by generating only the missing number of questions if needed.
   * Prepared for optional migration of cache from flat file (`questions_cache.json`) to a database for improved performance and persistence.

2. **💬 Input Field Tooltip for Better Prompting**

   * Added a speech-bubble style tooltip to the topic input field.
   * Tooltip appears on hover, guiding the user to provide **richer context** for better question generation (e.g., "china tibet occupation" instead of just "china").
   * Styled using custom CSS for subtle visibility and accessibility.

3. **🔎 Research: Additional AI Model Candidates**

   * Identified and evaluated other advanced AI models that can be added to the app:

     * **Claude** (Anthropic)
     * **Cohere**
     * **Mistral** (via Together AI or Hugging Face)
     * **OpenRouter.ai** (aggregated model access)
     * **Aleph Alpha**
     * **Google PaLM 2 (Vertex AI)**
   * Chose **Claude** (via OpenRouter) as the next integration target for its performance and ease of use.

**⚙️ Technical Enhancements**

* Enhanced question generator with `generateQuestions()` now checking for existing cache before triggering OpenAI API.
* Improved reusability by designing the cache to respond flexibly to partial reuse and additional top-ups.

---

**🚧 Challenges**

* Balancing logic between using cache, topping up, and refreshing stale data.
* Ensuring tooltip placement doesn't interfere with layout responsiveness.
* Identifying models with APIs that are production-ready and offer transparent usage limits and costs.

---

**📌 Next Steps**

* Integrate **Claude (Anthropic)** via OpenRouter.
* Modularize model-querying logic for better maintainability.
* Add optional cache expiration logic and cache clear button to UI.
* Evaluate sentiment consistency across different models using existing analyzer.
