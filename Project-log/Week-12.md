### üìÖ **Daily Log ‚Äì 13 May 2025**

**üß© Task Completed:**

* Researched and reviewed additional AI models for integration into the bias detection app.
* Identified 6 new potential models:

  * **Claude (Anthropic)**
  * **Cohere**
  * **Mistral** (via Together AI or Hugging Face)
  * **OpenRouter.ai** (aggregated access to multiple models)
  * **Aleph Alpha**
  * **Google PaLM 2 (via Vertex AI)**
* Evaluated models based on:

  * API availability
  * Use case alignment
  * Ease of integration with existing code structure
* Chose **Claude** (Anthropic) as the most suitable next integration due to strong performance, API simplicity, and compatibility with OpenRouter.

---

**‚öôÔ∏è Technical Progress:**

* Reviewed current implementation (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, LLaMA).
* Assessed future model compatibility with `/analyze-questions` API logic.
* Prepared to incorporate Claude using OpenRouter to simplify authentication and routing.

---

**üîç Challenges:**

* Some model APIs (like Mistral, PaLM) require enterprise setup or custom endpoints.
* Need to standardize integration wrappers for easier model switching or toggling in frontend.

---

**‚úÖ Next Steps:**

* Begin integration of **Claude** via OpenRouter.
* Abstract AI model querying logic into modular functions to ease future expansion.
* Update frontend UI to reflect model availability dynamically (e.g., Claude toggle).
* Evaluate sentiment result consistency from Claude vs GPT.
