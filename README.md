# ai-bias-check
This project is a web application for detecting and analysing bias in responses from different AI language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini). It allows users to input a subject, generate diverse questions around it, send them to various AI models, and analyse the sentiment and patterns of the responses to calculate a bias index.
